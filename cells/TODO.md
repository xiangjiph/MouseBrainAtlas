- [x] Show reconstructed images
- [ ] Use the peak and significance as features instead of histograms. Smooth, find peak, compute goodness.
- [ ] Specify the bins for largeLargeLinkJacHist, largeLargeLinkSizeDiffHist, largeLargeLinkOrientationDiffHist. See `compute_features_v2.ipynb`
- [ ] Investigate why `label_regions` returns items with zero counts.
- [ ] Investigate why some features contain nan.
- [ ] Investigate cases where some structures are too narrow to accomodate any region.
